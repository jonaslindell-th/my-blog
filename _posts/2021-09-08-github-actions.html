  Introduction to Github Actions, Continuous Integration (CI)
</h2>

<hr />

<h3>What is a CI Pipeline?</h3>

<p>
  CI is a practice which facilitates merging code to the main branch and/or
  commiting code to your branch continuously. By introducing a CI pipeline in
  Github actions for example, a commit to your branch or merge attempt to the
  main branch (depending on what triggers you choose to use), triggers a series
  of automated steps. These steps may involve running the code build, unit
  tests, code analysis and more.
</p>

<p>
  If a new branch were to pass all of the automated steps in the pipeline
  without any errors, a merge to the main branch is possible and may continue to
  the next stage e.g. deployment to the cloud. Should any of the steps fail, the
  development team may go through the error report, so that they may fix the
  issues and the merge attempt is prevented from progressing to any further
  stages.
</p>

<p>
  As to describe this proccess, the pipeline acts as a safety net between
  commits that may "break" the application and a fully functional deployment.
</p>

<h3>What benefits does CI bring to the table?</h3>

<p>
  By aiming at merging to the main branch often and in short iterations, running
  automated builds and tests continously through out development, developers can
  catch any errors early in the development stage. Reducing time spent trying to
  find and fix bugs as well as preventing them from reaching deployment.
</p>

<h3>How I implemented a CI pipeline into an existing project</h3>

<hr />

<p>
  As a first step, a .github directory is needed in my repository, this is where
  all Github specific files should be located. In this directory I introduce a
  workflows directory, this directory should contain my workflow yaml file, what
  I name this file besides from the .yaml extension is not important.
</p>

<p>
  Once I have my yaml file, I start off by naming my workflow, this will be
  displayed in my repository's actions page once I trigger the workflow.
</p>

<code>name: workflow demonstration</code>

<p>
  The next step is to add the "on:" event which specifies on what event github
  should trigger the workflow.
</p>

<code> name: workflow demonstration <br />on: [push] </code>

<p>
  Now I have to specify what jobs and steps to run once this event is triggered,
  I start by naming my job. In my case I choose to build the application and run
  my unit tests in this job, I find: "Run build and tests" a suitable name for
  this.
